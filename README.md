# Gender-Classification-Based-on-Turkish-Tweets

This project aims to classify gender based on Turkish tweets.

Three different methods were used for feature extraction. These are: Tf-idf, Word2Vec and GloVe.

Eight classification methods were used for Tf-idf and six classification methods were used for Word2Vec and GloVe.

For Tf-idf: XGBoost, K-Neighbors, SVC, Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB, MLP, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

For others:XGBoost, K-Neighbors, SVC, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

You can see the accuracy results in repo. If you run the main.py you can see the ROC and confusion matrix results for all feature extraction models.
